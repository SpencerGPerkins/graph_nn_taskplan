# Graph Neural Networks for Task Planning
** This is the repo for my current primary research in Graph Neural Networks for robotic Task planning**

## Below are some basics for using this codebase.

### Directory Guide
1. docs 
	- Results and figures from training
	
2. gnn 
	- The necessary scripts for using the model during inference only.
	
3. pddl_comp_data
	- Synthetic data for initial PDDL/GNN comparison experiment
	
4. run_data
	- Directory for input data and action execution history during inference
	
5. src
	- All source code

6. synthetic_data
	- synthetic data for training the model

7. synthetic_testing_data
	-synthetic data for testing the model
